This repository contains the MATLAB code used in Schretter et al. 2024 ("Social state alters vision using three circuit mechanisms in Drosophila") to analyze visual features during female aggression and male courtship behavior and generate the behavioral timeseries and averages depicted in the figures.

The timeseries data and averages used the code in the following directory: TimeseriesANDAvg. 
Note: This code requires your data to be in the registered_trx.mat format from the FlyDisco pipeline (see GitHub repo: https://github.com/kristinbranson/FlyDiscoAnalysis for more details on this pipeline). It has not been tested for compatibility with other inputs. Source data are supplied in the paper and in figshare (DOI: 10.25378/janelia.26847772).  

Visual features during male courtship used the code in the following directory: VisualFeaturesDuringCourtship.
Note: This code requires your data to be in the Caltech FlyTracker format. The data used for this code is supplied in the following figshare DOI: 10.25378/janelia.26847772. 

Visual features during female aggression used the following code: VisualFeaturesDuringFFAgg. 
Note: This code requires your data to be in the registered_trx.mat format from the FlyDisco pipeline (see GitHub repo: https://github.com/kristinbranson/FlyDiscoAnalysis for more details on this pipeline). It has not been tested for compatibility with Caltech FlyTracker only output and will need to be modified if this or another input is used. The data used for this code is supplied in the following figshare DOI: 10.25378/janelia.26847772.
